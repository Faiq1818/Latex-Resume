	% \project{}{Worked on a \href{https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/26/microsoft-excel-is-about-to-get-a-lot-smarter/}{project} to create an interface(Cards) for newly supported entity values in Excel on all endpoints (Win32, UWP, Android, iOS and Web). Part of the core team responsible for architectural design of the feature. Built initial prototypes for evaluation. One of the key contributors in multiple aspects of the initial implementation.}{Java, C++, C\#}
	% \project{}{Implemented React Native based componentized UI for cards on Android, iOS and Win32 endpoints. This reduced development efforts for the team as more code could be shared across all three platforms.}{JavaScript/TypeScript, React Native}
	% \project{}{Worked on leveraging \href{http://adaptivecards.io/}{Microsoft Adaptive Cards} to support multiple layouts in cards with ease. Developed a JSON data binding solution to complement adaptive cards schema. With this work a third-party content provider can author their own card layouts without any additional code.}{TypeScript}
